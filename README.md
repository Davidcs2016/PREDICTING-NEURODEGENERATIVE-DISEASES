# PREDICTING-NEURODEGENERATIVE-DISEASES
Neurodegenerative diseases are a heterogeneous group of disorders that are characterized by the progressive degeneration of the structure and function of the central nervous system or peripheral nervous system. These diseases cause your brain and nerves to deteriorate over time. They can change your personality and cause confusion. They can also destroy your brain’s tissue and nerves.
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to accurately predict the presence of a neurodegenerative disease in an individual as early detection of a neurodegenerative disease for the identification of people who can participate in trials of neuroprotective agents, or ultimately to try and halt disease progression once effective disease-modifying interventions have been identified.
